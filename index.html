            <p> <em>The town of Mir</em> was founded prior to 1345, it received Magdeburg rights in 1579. Mir
                is situated in Belarus. Untill 1795 it was a part of The Grand Duchy of Lithuania,
                after then Mir was acquired by the Russian Empire. The town of Mir is known worldwide
                by its medieval castle founded around 1520 by Duke Juryj Ivanavič Illinič.
                The Mir Castle was listed by
                <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/625/" target="_blank">

            <img src="https://github.com/Alesia999/Mir-Castle/blob/main/Mir%20castle.JPG" id="image">
            <p>The main attraction of the town of Mir is its castle. It was built in the
                Gothic style and is the most eastern Gothic castle in Europe. Its building
                is in the shape of a square with a side of 75 meters, and its walls are
                topped with 5 towers. It is spread out on the shore of a small lake.
                In 2011, the castle was opened after a long renovation, and now it
                attractes visitors as an independent museum.</p>
